## INSPIRATION

According to Philly By Air, at the end of 2019 there were 990,000 recreational operators registered and an estimated 1.32 million recreational drones in the United States. Insider Intelligence expects sales of drones to top $12 billion in 2021. However, there isn't much of an online community for these users to access and communicate. As an individual that is passionate about drone usage and video sharing, I wanted to create a platform where drone users can come and share content.

## WHAT IT DOES

Drone Dock is a platform that uses creativity to inspire people of all ages to share their drone footage. Anyone can create an account and start discovering videos from other users and also explore popular drone spots in their area. Each account has a profile, home page to create and store footage logs, and also a page to watch videos.

## WHAT'S NEXT

We plan to build out more features of our application including filters, search bars, progress bars, etc. and ultimately deploy the application to the Web. After doing so, we want to promote our platform to users interested in drones, so that we can grow our community around the world.
